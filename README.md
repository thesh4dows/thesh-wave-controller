# thesh-wave-controller
Its a diy project of a device that emulates the flipper zero but using well available and cheap parts.
Hi i'm thesh a 17 years old thinkerer that likes a lot to expirience with microcontrollers, i always 
wanted a Flipper Zero but the price it's always has been out of my reach so i always wanted to build one myself.
When i've se the Blueprint project i felt that is my chanche to build a "Flipper Zero 2" myself and then share my 
expirience and project with others. Another characteristic that my device will have is a high reparability so 
if there is any type of problem with the device it can be repaired without a sweat.
